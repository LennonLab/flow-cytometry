## Flow Cytometry Data Analysis using R

This repository contains open-source code and data to learn how to process, analyze, and visualize flow cytometry data based on a 2013 course from the [Canadian Bioinformatics Workshop](http://bioinformatics.ca/workshops/2013/flow-cytometry-data-analysis-using-r-2013). 
PDF and MP4 files are available for the course on the homepage.
